The lyrics are:

VERSE 1:
You're the one, we wait on you to come
We worship you, we worship you
Fill this place, glory on every face
We worship you, we worship you

CHORUS:
We lift our hands, lord
Here in your presence
We worship you, we worship you
Forever my savior
I live to praise you
We worship you, we worship you
